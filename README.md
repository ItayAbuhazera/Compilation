# Compiler Construction Project

## Overview
This project, part of a Compiler Construction course, involves developing a compiler in OCaml and x86 assembly language. It's structured into three main assignments, each focusing on different compiler development aspects.

## Assignments

### Assignment 1
- **Objective**: Implement specific sections in `compiler.ml` marked with `raise (X_not_yet_implemented "hw 1")`.
- **Language**: OCaml
- **Environment**: Platform-independent

### Assignment 2
- **Objective**: Similar to Assignment 1, complete sections in `compiler.ml` indicated by `raise (X_not_yet_implemented "hw 2")`.
- **Language**: OCaml
- **Environment**: Platform-independent

### Final Project
- **Objective**: Write x86 assembly code for Linux, finishing parts in `compiler.ml` tagged as `raise (X_not_yet_implemented "final project")`.
- **Language**: OCaml and x86 Assembly
- **Environment**: Linux-specific
- **Tools**: Includes `compile_scheme_string`, `compile_scheme_file`, and `compile_and_run_scheme_string` for testing and debugging.

## General Guidelines
- Work individually or in pairs.
- Avoid plagiarism.
- Commit to thorough testing and debugging.
- Maintain clean and efficient code.

## Testing
- Regular testing is essential for effective debugging.
- Utilize provided tools for testing assembly code.

## Contribution
- Ensure a clear understanding of each task.
- Commit regularly and document changes effectively.
